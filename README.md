# Joi
Supreme Bot with an UI; based of my CopBot project

Windows and MacOS

Chrome Driver version 96

-- UPDATES --

- Update v.0.0.2: Added chrome auto log in support; for this you will need to enter your PC's Username (further explained by clicking the '?' button next to it). This is supposed to reduce bot detection. This is necessary for the bot to work from now on.

- Selenium bypass got patched. So you have to manually enter captcha and one only has one chance.

- checkout speed reduced from 14.8s to 10s

- Update v.0.0.11: Added delay function; added new "automated software" bypass; tested and finished with 14800ms (14.8s) fastest speed checkout (total). Working on reducing speed checkout time without reducing success rate.

- Update v.0.0.1 New UI

Chromedriver modified to bypass Selenium detection.

---HOW TO USE---

Donwload and unzip the zip file "Joi.v.0.0.11.zip" in the "Releases" section.

Run/Doubleclick the "Joi" java file

The chromedriver has always to be in the same folder/directory as the java file for it to work

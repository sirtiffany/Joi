- Update v.0.0.11: Added delay function; added new "automated software" bypass; tested and finished with 14800ms (14.8s) fastest speed checkout (total). Working on reducing speed checkout time without reducing success rate.

Chromedriver modified to bypass Selenium detection.

---HOW TO USE---

Donwload and unzip the zip file "Joi.v.0.0.11.zip" in the "Releases" section.
